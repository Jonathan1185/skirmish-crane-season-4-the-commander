# Skirmish at Crane Reach agent

Edit `agent.py` to build one unit's behavior for Skirmish at Crane Reach. Every unit on a side runs a separate instance of the same `Agent` class, so they do not share state or variables. `sandbox/` is provided code: do not edit it.

Start with the [Getting Started guide](https://vox-deorum.github.io/game-sandbox/students/getting-started/). Then run these commands from this folder as you work:

```console
python -m sandbox play   # command a side yourself in your browser
python -m sandbox watch  # watch your agent take on Naive
python -m sandbox test   # run the provided checks
python -m sandbox eval   # compare your agent with Naive
```

**Naive** is a simple built-in opponent. It holds the other side in `watch` and `eval`, and `eval` reports your side's average score over repeatable matches. The [`environment.md`](environment.md) guide explains rivals, presets, and the other command options.

## Files you will use

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `agent.py` | Your `Agent` implementation and the first TODO locations. |
| `environment.md` | Crane rules, starter walkthrough, helpers, observations, and settings. |
| `manifest.json` | Names the agent class for a submission. |
| `season.json` | Optional local season settings downloaded from My Submissions. |
| `tests/` | Checks your submission should pass. |
| `sandbox/` | Local game, commands, helper package, and observation types. Do not edit it. |
| `requirements.txt` | Exact Python package versions used by the server. |
| `requirements-dev.txt` | Test dependencies. |
| `.env.example` | Example local LLM settings. |

The starter returns Crane orders with `action.move()` and `action.stay()` from `sandbox.crane`. Its `act(observation)` receives the current observation and action mask. Before changing the strategy, read [`environment.md`](environment.md). It starts with a small archer improvement you can copy, then explains when an order is legal.

Leave `sandbox/`, `requirements.in`, and `requirements.txt` unchanged. The pinned packages match the server. Ask your instructor before adding a package.

When your agent is ready, follow the shared [submitting guide](https://vox-deorum.github.io/game-sandbox/students/submitting/). For the optional `learn` and `chat` hooks, see the shared [agent interface](https://vox-deorum.github.io/game-sandbox/students/agent-interface/). Crane messaging begins in Season 3.

## Optional LLM API

If your instructor enables model calls, follow [Using the LLM API](llm.md). Copy `.env.example` to `.env`, add the endpoint and key, and never commit either secret.

Test the connection with:

```console
python -m sandbox llm
```
##Design Goal: My design goal was to make the archer smarter by helping it try to get away from the enemy and make it go close to the footmen. In addition to this the calvalry go into the capture area and once they perish the footmen go then the archers. Additionally I tried making the footmen more focused on protecting the archer while the calvary is still alive.

##Short Reflection: After seeing how to the agent behaves I knew that I also wanted the archer to try and be the smartest out of the three different NPC because it is the lowest health unit. I also wanted the capture area to play a major part of it so I made the calvary job to capture it then the footmen then the archers.

#AI Disclosure and reflection: I used a AI agent (Codex) for my agent to help with the unit behavior and agent navigation.
